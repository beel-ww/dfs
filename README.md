A distributed file system application based on a UBC CS416 assignment.

[UBC page](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/assign2/index.html)

Original Stub Files
[dfslib.go](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/assign2/dfslib.go)
[app.go](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/assign2/app.go)

All code other than what is in the original stubs is written by me.
This is my first project using golang. I had no prior experience with RPCs or implementing distributed systems.

# Current To-dos/Wishlist

- improve error handling
- lots of refactoring
